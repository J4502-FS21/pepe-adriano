        <h6>Text and photo by Jose Luis Adriano</h6>
        <p>It’s very easy to classify off-campus housing in Columbia in one of these categories: downtown buildings, standalone houses and apartments, and out-of-town residencies. With a student population of around 30 thousand, Mizzou certainly demands a steady supply of tenants that housing providers in Columbia are more than happy to attend.</p>
        <p>Downtown buildings: Apartments with 2 to 4 roommates, private or shared bathrooms, extra amenities available (gym and/or pool), and usually furnished. Managed by a company, not individual landlords, and you pay for your own room, not the entire unit. Utilities are included.</p>
        <p>Standalone houses: Properties scattered around Columbia’s downtown and surrounding neighborhoods, most of them old but in good shape, and usually not furnished. Because they’ll rent you the whole unit, it gets cheaper in the long term, after you share the expenses with your roommates. Utilities are not included, so keep that in mind.</p>
        <p>Out-of-town residencies: furnished or unfurnished housing located on the outskirts of Columbia, with free shuttle services provided. They are sometimes cheaper than downtown’s options because of their location, but that also means that they can offer bigger bedrooms and apartments. They could be a good option if you don’t mind the distance, or if you prefer a quieter place, far from the sometimes-noisy downtown area.</p>
        <h3>University Place</h3>
        <p>Convenient, affordable, furnished and very close to campus. Those are the main advantages, but there are also several drawbacks: it’s an old building, the apartments’ kitchen is very small, and the only windows are located in the bedrooms, meaning that there’s no natural light for the living room (unless you get some of the few luxury units with an extra window in the living room).</p>
        <h3>Rise on 9th</h3>
        <p>One, if not the most luxurious off-campus housing you’ll find in CoMo’s downtown. It’s a fairly new building where big windows are priority, as well as privacy: these apartments have private bathroom in every bedroom, while the living room and kitchen is shared. But it comes with a price: rents here are usually around $900 per month.</p>
        <h3>The Reserve at Columbia</h3>
        <p>As the many housing options that are located on the Columbia’s suburbs, The Reserve offers spacious bedrooms and rents that are a bit cheaper than the places downtown. The reason is distance: it’s definitely not walking distance from campus, meaning you’ll have to have a car, or use of the shuttle services available to you. Rents can go between the $400 - $800 per person, depending on early move-in, or number of bedrooms – the more bedrooms, the cheaper it gets per person.</p>
        <h3>Brookside Downtown</h3>
        <p>This non-exhaustive list wouldn’t be complete without Brookside, one of the main off-campus housings available for students in Columbia. With several buildings in downtown, there’s certain you’ll find parties every weekend in at least one of their units, ran by -largely- undergrad students. Whether this appeals to you or not it’s another conversation topic, but as far as amenities and prices, their options are wide. Prices are in the $700 - $900 monthly per month, with furnished units ready for you to move in.</p>
