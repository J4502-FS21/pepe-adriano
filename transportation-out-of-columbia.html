        <p>Columbia is a mid-size located conveniently in the middle of the two biggest cities in Missouri, which are Kansas City and St. Louis, and you can reach any in around 2 hours. Both St. Louis and Kansas City have big airports that can connect you with many destinations, so here’s what you need to know if you are a carless student wanting to visit these cities, as well as your options inside the local airport in Columbia.</p>
        <h3>Columbia International Airport</h3>
        <p>As its name says, you won’t find international flights coming or going out of the Columbia Regional Airport. But it connects Columbia to the cities of Dallas and Chicago, which is helpful for international students to consider in case they want to arrive directly to Columbia from one of these connection cities.</p>
        <p>There used to be flights with American Airlines and United Airlines, but United decided to retire all its flights in COU due to low demand. However, a new terminal is expected to open in Summer 2022, with the promise of new flights and destinations. </p>
        <h3>Greyhound</h3>
        <p>Greyhound is a bus company that runs across the U.S. with several routes that connect most of the cities. In paper it sounds like a good deal, but its service is far from being good. The buses rarely arrive in time, but I’m not talking about a delay or an hour or so: sometimes, your bus will be delayed for even more than 8 hours, which could severely affect your whole itinerary. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it’s the only bus company that comes to Columbia, and since their fares are very cheap, sometimes Greyhound will be your only option to get out of town if you are on a budget and in need of going to Kansas City or St. Louis.</p>
        <h3>MoX</h3>
        <p>A local transportation company, MoX offers shuttles from COU and back to the St. Louis International Airport. Prices are $65 per one way ticket, and it’s a reliable and fast service, but rather expensive if you only needed to get to St. Louis to take a flight from there, so you’ll have to add that to your budget plans.</p>
