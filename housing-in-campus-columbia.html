        <p>If you are reading this, chances are you're like me — an international student that came to Mizzou to do their Master's or PhD. But it you're a freshman, then I'll point in the right direction: the Residential Life's website, because a whole different set of rules would apply to you. </p>
        <p>That being said: finding a place to stay it's going to certainly be among the top priorities to guarantee a happy arrival to Columbia and a smooth transition to your new life. </p>
        <p>Grad students coming to Mizzou don’t have a lot of options in housing facilitated by the University. Until Fall 2021, we had two buildings: Manor House and Tara Apartments, but Manor House, a building that the university bought back in 1996, it’s being demolished in June 2021, so they’re not welcoming any more tenants. In fact, they’re kicking out current tenants -mostly international students- once their contract expires. It was a big deal, and the Missourian covered it in detail. </p>
        <p>Tara Apartments, on the other hand, are a complex of duplex buildings, walking-ish distance from campus, which offer one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. They’re unfurnished, except for the kitchen appliances (stove and fridge), and some might have laundry machines. But since the two-bedroom unit can come in standard and large size, these apartments usually appeal to grad students wanting to move in with their families.</p>
        <p>It’s not my intention to replicate Residential Life’s content, where you can access a video tour and consult more about the building amenities. There’s something missing in their website, though. The application process, and the price, that I’ll explain based on my experience.</p>
        <h3>How to send an application</h3>
        <p>Applications to Tara Apartments for the Fall semester usually open in March each year. You’ll need to send an email to muhousing@missori.edu, and someone would reply informing you about the options available. </p>
        <p>Price for a standard size, two-bedroom unit, was $635 per month as of the 2020-2021 Academic year. And there’s a catch: if you get offered one of the two-bedroom units, you -the person who signs the contract- are responsible for finding a new roommate in case you aren’t coming with your family or partner. This also means that when you do find a roommate, each of you will be paying around $320, which is definitely cheap. It might work for you, but if it doesn’t, there are many off-campus housing options for you.</p>
